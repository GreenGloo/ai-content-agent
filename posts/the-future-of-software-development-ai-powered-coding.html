                        <h4>Start Simple, Scale Smart</h4>
                        <p>Begin with a minimal viable implementation and add complexity as needed. Over-engineering early can slow development and increase costs.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Monitor Everything</h4>
                        <p>Comprehensive monitoring from day one helps identify issues before they become critical problems. Invest in good observability tools.</p>

                        <h4>Plan for Growth</h4>
                        <p>Design your architecture to handle 10x growth from the start. It's easier to plan for scale than to retrofit scalability later.</p>

                        <h4>Security First</h4>
                        <p>Security considerations should be built in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought. Security debt is expensive to fix.</p>
