# Google Analytics Setup Guide

## Issue: Stuck in Organization Account

If you can't create properties due to organization restrictions:

### Solution 1: Use Personal Gmail
1. Sign out of current Google account
2. Sign in with personal Gmail (not work email)
3. Go to analytics.google.com
4. Create new account/property

### Solution 2: Create New Gmail
1. Create new Gmail account just for your website
2. Use that account for Google Analytics
3. Set up TrendCatcher property

### Solution 3: Contact Organization Admin
- Ask organization admin to give you property creation permissions
- Or ask them to remove you from the organization

## Once You Have Access:

1. **Create Account:** "TrendCatcher Analytics"
2. **Create Property:** "TrendCatcher Website" 
3. **Add Data Stream:** Your GitHub Pages URL
4. **Copy Measurement ID:** G-XXXXXXXXXX
5. **Update tracking code** in your website files

## Alternative: Basic GitHub Traffic

For now, you can see basic traffic in:
- GitHub repo → Settings → Insights → Traffic
- Shows page views and unique visitors (limited data)
