# Amazon Affiliate Link Best Practices

## The Reality: Amazon Blocks Automated Validation

After testing, Amazon returns 503 errors for all automated requests, making programmatic ASIN validation impossible. Here's the practical approach:

## Proven Working Methods

### 1. Use Amazon's SiteStripe Tool (Manual but Reliable)
- Log into Amazon Associates dashboard
- Browse to actual products on Amazon.com  
- Use SiteStripe browser extension to generate affiliate links
- This guarantees working links since you're seeing the live product

### 2. Stick to Stable Product Categories
**Most Reliable ASINs:**
- **Books with ISBNs**: Often stable for years (use 10-digit ISBN as ASIN)
- **Popular electronics**: Major brand products with high sales volume
- **Amazon's Choice products**: Less likely to be discontinued

**Avoid:**
- New/niche products with low reviews
- Seasonal items
- Products from unknown brands

### 3. Manual Testing Process
Since automation doesn't work, use this manual process:

1. **Before Adding to Articles:**
   ```bash
   # Test in browser (not curl - Amazon blocks it)
   https://www.amazon.com/dp/[ASIN]?tag=trendcatcher9-20
   ```

2. **Look for These Warning Signs:**
   - "Dogs of Amazon" error page
   - "Currently unavailable" messages  
   - Product page redirects to search results

3. **Monthly Link Audits:**
   - Check top-performing articles manually
   - Replace broken links immediately
   - Keep backup product recommendations ready

## Recommended Approach for Your Site

**For Now - Remove Broken Links:**
Since all current affiliate links are broken and I can't validate replacements programmatically, the safest approach is:

1. **Temporarily remove affiliate product sections** from all articles
2. **Keep the affiliate recommendation infrastructure** (CSS, layout)
3. **Manually add 1-2 verified working products per article** using SiteStripe

**Long-term Strategy:**
1. **Apply for Amazon PA API access** (requires 3 sales first)
2. **Use SiteStripe for manual link generation** until API access
3. **Focus on software affiliate programs** (DigitalOcean, GitHub, etc.) which don't have broken link issues

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Remove all current broken affiliate links temporarily?
2. Keep the infrastructure but disable product recommendations?
3. Focus on the working software affiliate programs instead?

The honest answer is: Amazon makes affiliate link validation extremely difficult, and manual processes are the only reliable method.
